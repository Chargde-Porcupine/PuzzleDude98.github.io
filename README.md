This is a simple website that is both informational and fun
I've started out with some small flash games for the fun part.
For the informational, I've started with Leonardo da Vinci, a personal hero.
If you have some good coding experience, please help me debug the quiz on LeonardoQuiz.html. There are comments for ease.
